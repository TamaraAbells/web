        <h2>8. No Liability For Third Party Services And Content</h2>
          <p>8.1. In using our Services, you may view content or utilize services provided by third parties, including links to web pages and services of such parties (&quot;Third Party Content&quot;). We do not control, endorse or adopt any Third-Party Content and will have no responsibility for Third Party Content including, without limitation, material that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable in your jurisdiction. In addition, your dealings or correspondence with such third parties are solely between you and the third parties. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of any such dealings and you understand that your use of Third Party Content, and your interactions with third parties, is at your own risk.</p>
        <h2>9. Account Registration</h2>
          <p>9.1. You need not use a Steemhunt Account. If you wish to use an Account, you must create an Account with Steemhunt to access the Services (&quot;Account&quot;). When you create an Account, you are strongly advised to take the following precautions, as failure to do so may result in loss of access to, and/or control over, your Wallet: (a) Create a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) Provide accurate and truthful information; (c) Maintain and promptly update your Account information; (d) maintain the security of your Account by protecting your Account password and access to your computer and your Account; (e) Promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Account.</p>
          <p>9.2. You hereby accept and acknowledge that you take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Account and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Account, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h2>10. The Steemhunt Services</h2>
          <p>10.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things, provide in-browser (or otherwise local) software that (a) generates and stores STEEM ACCOUNT Addresses and encrypted Private Keys (defined below), and (b) Facilitates the submission of STEEM transaction data to the Steem network without requiring you to access the STEEM command line interface.</p>
          <p>10.2. Account Names and Private Keys. When you create an Account, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive STEEM and Steem Dollars via the Steem network. The Private Key uniquely matches the Account Name and must be used in connection with the Account Name to authorize the transfer of STEEM and Steem Dollars from that Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Private Key and any password phrase associated with your wallet. You must keep your Account, password phrase and Private Key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars associated with the Wallet.</p>
          <p>10.3. No Password Retrieval. Steemhunt does not receive or store your Account password, or the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Account password retrieval. Our Services provide you with tools to help you remember or recover your password, including by allowing you to set password hints, but the Services cannot generate a new password for your Account. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Account Names and password pairs maintained in your Account, you accept and acknowledge that any STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power you have associated with such Account will become inaccessible if you do not have your Account password.</p>
          <p>10.4. Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Steem transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Steem public ledger via the Steem distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer economic network that operates on a cryptographic protocol), which is not owned, controlled or operated by Steemhunt. The Steem Network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. Blockchain has no control over the Steem network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Steem network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Steem network. You may use the Services to submit these details to the network.</p>
          <p>10.5. No Storage or Transmission of STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power. Steem, in any of its forms (STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power) is an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Steem network. The Service does not store, send or receive Steem. Any transfer of title that might occur in any STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power occurs on the decentralized ledger within the Steem network and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service can effect the transfer of title or right in any Steem, Steem Dollars or Steem Power.</p>
          <p>10.6. Relationship. Nothing in these Terms is intended to nor shall create any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy or trusteeship, you and Steemhunt being with respect to one another independent contractors.</p>
          <p>10.7. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that Steemhunt is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Steem transaction initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype an Account Name or otherwise provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.</p>
          <p>10.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Steem network via the Services, The Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. Steemhunt has no control over the Steem Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.</p>
          <p>10.9. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Steemhunt is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Steem transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Steem transactions.</p>
        <h2>11. Fees for Using the Steemhunt Services</h2>
          <p>11.1. 10% beneficiaries will be used for Steemhunt operation, and another 5% for sponsors who delegated Steem Power to @steemhunt.</p>
        <h2>12. No Right To Cancel And&sol;Or Reverse Steem Transactions</h2>
          <p>12.1. If you use a Service to which Steem, Steem Dollars or Steem Power is transacted, you will not be able to change your mind once you have confirmed that you wish to proceed with the Service or transaction.</p>
        <h2>13. Discontinuation of Services</h2>
          <p>13.1. We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible for storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any Account and Private Key pair that you maintain in your Wallet.</p>
          <p>13.2. If you do not maintain a backup of your Account data outside of the Services, you will be may not be able to access Steem, Steem Dollars and Steem Power associated with any Account Name maintained in your Account in the event that we discontinue or deprecate the Services.</p>
        <h2>14. Suspension or Termination of Service.</h2>
          <p>14.1. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services in our sole discretion, immediately and without prior notice, and delete or deactivate your Account and all related information and files in such without cost to you, including, for instance, in the event that you breach any term of these Terms. In the event of termination, your access to funds will depend on your access to your backup of your Account data including your Account Name and Private Keys.</p>
        <h2>15. User Conduct</h2>
